Democrats will control the House and Republicans will control the Senate. 

The 2018 midterm election has brought the two political parties to present very different messages about what they consider to be the most important issues at hand for the American public. The Democratic party focuses on healthcare, while the Republican Party focuses on immigration and race. Because they focus on different issues in the campaigns, I predict that money will drive the results of the election. Democrats have raised more money than Republicans in the house race: $923 million for candidates versus $612 million.

Money wins elections. Looking at some key districts, I predict that Kim Schrier (D) will win the election in Washington 8th district because of her focus on healthcare and fundraising at double that of Rossi (R). In California 10th district, I predict that Josh Harder will win as he raised approximately 5x his opponent. 

I predict that Republicans will keep the Senate. This is because 42 Republican seats are not up for election versus 23 Democratic seats. We do not think that the differential in fundraising in the senate race will allow Democrats, even if they have raised more money, will be able to gain enough seats to get a majority.
